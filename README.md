Fun project with JavaScript

I found this really fun project when following Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/?couponCode=C3WEBSITE1010&utm_source=mycoupon&utm_medium=website1010&utm_campaign=website1010). I hope to develop it more. I already add some music stuff ðŸ˜‹. Do you guyz have any new ideas or features to add to this funny project? Please let me know ðŸ˜‰
